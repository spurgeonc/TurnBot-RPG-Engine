<h1>Welcome to TurnBot RPG Engine</h1>
<hr>

TurnBot RPG Engine is a free-to-use, open-source engine for creating browser-based, top-down RPGs. <br> This is just a hard-coded prototype, and not quite usable yet, but regardless, all are free to copy this code and make whatever they want with it. <br> Just as long as you give credit and give others those same freedoms.
